Grungy Lights Texture Pack
v1.0
----

These textures were made for UFO: Alien Invasion and are licensed under GNU GPL 2 or later.

Each texture has a normal map, specularity map and glow map (where appropriate). These use the suffix _nm, _sm and _gm.

The file "light003_shell" is made to tile and can be used for the other faces of a light model. It's designed to roughly match the frames in the light textures.
