# CellCraft-Unity

 This will be a Unity version of the science game CellCraft.  The core engine will be rebuilt, minus the old analytics code and stat reporters (more current substitutes TBD). 
 
 Efficiency passes can be done after everything is successfully translated; the initial focus will be to get the core content to work.  "MovieClips" can be simulated in Unity easily enough with sprite arrays and determining the largest sprite's width and height. Some legacy code may not even be needed (the Vector2 library, for example). 
 



Note: Some of the cinematic scenes seem to be missing from the open source repo; namely, everything from the first couple of "scene" classes.
